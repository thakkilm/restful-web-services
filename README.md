# Creating restful-web-services

- To handle bad responses, I have created an ExceptionHandler by extending the `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` class.
- For the documentation of APIs, I have used the Swagger-UI dependencies.
- For content negotiation (converting JSON to XML and vice versa), I have used the `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat` dependency.
